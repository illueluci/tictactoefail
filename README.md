# tictactoefail
this is the first attempt of pygame game I made myself without tutorial.
Graphics is okay, but I cannot figure out the AI.
Back in first year of university, I (+ a genius classmate) made a robot to play tictactoe, and the AI algorithym just used else-if. Somehow, it's tougher now...
